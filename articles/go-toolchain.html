<h1>The Go Toolchain</h1>

<p>
Currently, the tools in the official Go Toolchain (called Go Toolchain later)
are the most used tools to develop Go projects.
In Go 101 article series, all examples are compiled and verified with the standard Go compiler.
</p>

<p>
This article will introduce how to setup the Go development environment
and how to run simple Go programs.
Some tools of Go Toolchain will also be introduced.
</p>

<h3>Install Go Toolchain</h3>

<p>
Please <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">download</a> Go Toolchain
and install it according to the instructions shown in the download page.
</p>

<p>
The version of a Go Toolchain release is consistent with
the highest Go language version the release supports.
For example, Go Toolchain 1.15.x supports all Go language versions from 1.0 to Go 1.15.
</p>

<p>
The path to the <code>bin</code> subfolder in Go Toolchain installation root path
must be put in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable to execute the tools
(mainly the <code>go</code> subcommands) provided in Go Toolchain without inputting their full paths.
If your Go Toolchain is installed through an installer or with a package manager, the path to
the <code>bin</code> subfolder may have been already set in the <code>PATH</code>
environment variable automatically for you.
</p>

<p>
Earlier Go Toolchain versions might require <code>GOROOT</code> and
<code>GOPATH</code> environment variables to be set.
Recent Go Toolchain versions have no such requirements.
The default value of the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable is
the path to the <code>go</code> folder under the home directory of the current user.
<code>GOPATH</code> environment variable may list multiple paths.
</p>

<p>
There is a <code>GOBIN</code> environment variable which controls
where the binary files generated by some <code>go</code> subcommands,
such as the <code>go install</code> subcommand (see below), will be stored.
If the environment variable is not set, the <code>go</code> command will
use the path to <code>bin</code> subfolder in the first path specified in the
<code>GOPATH</code> environment variable to store the generated binary files.
The path to the folder for storing the binary files should be set in the <code>PATH</code>
environment variable to run the binary files without specifying their full paths.
</p>

<p>
Before Go Toolchain 1.11, it is recommended to put all custom Go packages into the
<code>src</code> subfolder of any path specified in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable,
in particular when a Go project depends on some third party packages.
Packages will be introduced in <a href="packages-and-imports.html">packages and imports</a> later.
</p>

<p>
In Go Toolchain 1.11, an experimental feature, Go modules, is supported.
The Go modules feature lets us put our Go projects freely in any folder.
We can get more module releated information from
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules">this wiki page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note, since Go Toolchain 1.13,
the Go modules feature becomes as the preferred mode (to the old <code>GOPATH</code> mode).
The necessity and meaningfulenss of the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable
will be weakened much, even be abolished eventually.
On the other hand, the importance of the <code>GOBIN</code> environment variable will be promoted,
for there is still a need to store the binary files produced by some <code>go</code> subcommands.
</p>

<p>
It is planned that the Go modules feature will be enabled by default since the next version (1.16).
</p>

<!--
<p><i>
(Before Go Toolchain 1.9, a <code>GOROOT</code> environment variable had to be configured
as the root path of the Go Toolchain installation.
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.9#goroot">With Go Toolchain 1.9</a>,
this environment variable became optional, and it is recommended to leave it unset.)
</i></p>

<p>
Before Go Toolchain 1.8, a <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable must be set.
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.8#gopath">Since Go Toolchain 1.8</a>,
the default value of this environment variable is the path of the <code>go</code>
folder under the home directory of the current user.
You may specify <code>GOPATH</code> manually in order to work with one (or more) different location(s).
Yes, the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable may list multiple paths.
</p>

<h3>The Simplest Go Program</h3>

<div>
<p>
Let's write a simple example and learn how to run simple Go programs.
</p>

The following program is the simplest Go program.
<pre class="line-numbers must-line-numbers fixed-width"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The words <code>package</code> and <code>func</code> are two keywords.
The two <code>main</code> words are two identifiers.
Keywords and identifiers are introduced in
<a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html">a coming article</a>.
</p>

<p>
The first line <code>package main</code> specifies the package name
(<code>main</code> here) of the source file.
</p>

<p>
The second line is a blank line for better readability.
</p>

<p>
The remaining code declares a function
which is also called <code>main</code>.
This <code>main</code> function in a <code>main</code> package
specifies the entry point of a program.
(Note that some other user code might be executed
before the <code>main</code> function gets invoked.)
</p>

</div>

<h3>Run Go Programs</h3>

<div>

<p>
Go Toolchain requires that Go source code file
to have the extension <code>.go</code>.
Here, we assume the above source code is saved in a file
named <code>simplest-go-program.go</code>.
</p>

Open a terminal and change the current directory to the directory
which contains the above source file, then run
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run simplest-go-program.go
</code></pre>

<p>
Nothing is output? Yes, this program outputs nothing.
</p>

<p>
If there are some syntax errors in the source code,
then these errors will be reported as compilation errors.
</p>

If multiple source files are in the <code>main</code> package of a program,
then we should run the program with the following command
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run .
</code></pre>

<p>
Note, the <code>go run</code> command is not recommended to compile and run large Go projects.
It is just a convenient way to run simple Go programs, like the ones in the Go 101 articles.
For large Go projects, please use the commands <code>go build</code> or <code>go install</code>
to build and create executable binary files instead.
</p>

</div>

<h3>More <code>go</code> Subcommands</h3>


<p>
The three commands, <code>go run</code>, <code>go build</code> and <code>go install</code>,
only output code syntax errors (if any).
They don't (try to) output code warnings (a.k.a., possible code logic mistakes).
We can use the <code>go vet</code> command to check and report such warnings.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go fmt</code> command to format Go source code
with a consistent coding style.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go get</code> command to get a remote third-party go package to local.
<code>go get</code> requires the corresponding version control tool must be installed.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go test</code> command to run tests and benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go doc</code> command to view Go documentation in terminal windows.
</p>

<p>
Since Go Toolchain 1.11, we can use the <code>go mod</code> command to manage dependencies.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go help aSubCommand</code> command to view the help message for a specified sub command.
</p>

<p>
The <code>go</code> command run without any arguments
shows the supported subcommands.
</p>

<p>
The Go 101 article series will not explain much more on how to use the tools provided in Go Toolchain.
Please read the <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/">official documentation</a> for details.
</p>

<a class="anchor" id="doc"></a>
<h3>View Go Documentation in Browsers</h3>

<div>
<p>
We can view all kinds of Go documentation on the official Go
website <a href="https://golang.org">golang.org</a>
and package docs on <a href="https://pkg.go.dev">go.dev</a>.
</p>

<p>
We can also install the <b>godoc</b> program by running
<code>go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc</code>,
then run <code>godoc -http=:9999</code> to start a local clone of Go
official website at <a href="http://localhost:9999">localhost:9999</a>.
The <b>godoc</b> tool can also be used to view docs of Go projects locally.
</p>

<p>
Another docs view tool is <b>Gold</b>, which is developed by me (Tapir Liu).
<b>Gold</b> supports rich code reading experience and lists type implementation relations.
We can run <code>go get -u go101.org/gold</code> to install <b>Gold</b>.
To utilize the <code>GOPROXY</code> setting in the installation process,
currently (Go Toolchain 1.15), the <code>GO111MODULE</code> enviroment variable
needs to be set as <code>on</code> before starting the installation.
We can also clone <a href="https://github.com/go101/gold"><b>Gold</b>'s source code</a>,
then run <code>go install</code> in the project directory to install <b>Gold</b>.
After the installation, we can run <code>gold std</code> to read the docs of the standard packages.
</p>
