<h1>Code Packages And Package Imports</h1>

<p>
Like many modern programming languages,
Go code is also organized as code packages.
To use the exported resources (functions, types, variables and named constants,
etc) in a specified package, the package must first be imported,
except the <code>builtin</code> standard code package.
This article will explain code packages and package imports in Go.
</p>

<h3>Introduction Of Package Import</h3>

<div>
Let's view a small program which imports a standard code package.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Go has", 25, "keywords.")
}
</code></pre>

Some Explanations:
<ul>
<li>
	The third line imports the <code>fmt</code> standard package.
	There are many format functions declared in this package for other packages to use.
	The <code>Println</code> function is one of them.
	It will print the string representations of
	an arbitrary number of arguments to the standard output.
	For each <code>fmt.Println</code> call,
	a space character will be inserted between
	each two consecutive string representations
	and a newline character is printed at the end.
</li>
<li>
	The sixth line calls the <code>Println</code> function.
	Note that the function name is prefixed a <code>fmt.</code> in the call,
	where <code>fmt</code> is the name of the package which contains the called function.
	The form <code>fmt.Println</code> is called a
	<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Qualified_identifiers">qualified identifier</a>.
</li>
<li>
	A <code>fmt.Println</code> function call has no requirements
	for its arguments, so in this program, its three arguments
	will be deduced as values of their respective default types,
	<code>string</code>, <code>int</code> and <code>string</code>.
</li>
</ul>

Assume the solo source file of this program is <code>simple-import-demo.go</code>,
run this program will get the following output:
<pre class="output"><code>$ go run simple-import-demo.go
Go has 25 keywords.
</code></pre>

<p>
Please note, only exported resources in a package can be used
in the source file which imports the package.
Exported resources are the resources whose names are
<a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html#identifier">exported identifiers</a>.
For example, the first character of the identifier <code>Println</code>
is an upper case letter (so the <code>Println</code> function is exported),
which is why the <code>Println</code> function
declared in the <code>fmt</code> standard package can be used
in the above example program.
</p>

<p>
The built-in functions, <code>print</code> and <code>println</code>,
have similar functionalites as the corresponding functions in the
<code>fmt</code> standard package.
Built-in functions can be used without importing any packages.
However, the two built-in functions are not recommended
to be used in production enviroments,
for they are not guaranteed to stay in the future Go versions.
</p>

<p>
All standard packages are listed <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/">here</a>.
We can also <a href="go-sdk.html#doc">run a local server</a>
to view Go documentations.
</p>

<p>
A package import is also called an import declaration formally in Go.
An import declaraton is only visible to the source file which contains the import declaration.
It is not visible to other source files in the same package.
</p>

Let's view another example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "math/rand"

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Next pseudo-random number is always %v.\n", rand.Uint32())
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This example imports one more standard package, the <code>math/rand</code> package,
which is a sub-package of the <code>math</code> standard package.
This package provides some functions to produce pseudo-random numbers.
</p>

Some explanations:
<ul>
<li>
	the last token in an import path will be used as the first part in a qualified identifier.
	In this example, <code>rand.</code> instead of <code>math/rand.</code> is used
	as the prefix of the <code>Uint32</code> function call.
	A <code>rand.Uint32()</code> call will return
	a random <code>uint32</code> integer number.
</li>
<li>
	<code>Printf</code> is another common used function
	in the <code>fmt</code> standard package.
	A call to the <code>Printf</code> function must take at least one arguments.
	The first argument of a <code>Printf</code> function call must be a <code>string</code> value,
	which specifies the format of the printed result.
	The <code>%v</code> in the first argument is called a format verb,
	it will be replaced with the string representation of the second argument.
	As we have learned in the article
	<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">basic types and their
	literals</a>, the <code>\n</code> in a double-quoted
	string literal will be escaped as a newline character.
</li>
</ul>

The above program will always output:
<pre class="output"><code>Next pseudo-random number is always 2596996162.
</code></pre>

<p>
If we expect the above program to produce a different random number at each run,
we should set a different seed by calling the <code>rand.Seed</code> function
when the program just starts.
</p>

<p>
If multiple packages are imported into a source file,
we can group them in one import declaration by enclosing
them in a <code>()</code>.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

// Multiple packages can be imported together.
import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) // set the random seed.
	fmt.Printf("Next pseudo-random number is %v.\n", rand.Uint32())
}
</code></pre>

Some explanations:
<ul>
<li>
	this example imports one more package,
	the <code>time</code> standard package,
	which provides many time realated utilities.
</li>
<li>
	function <code>time.Now()</code> returns the current time,
	as a value of type <code>time.Time</code>.
<li>
	<code>UnixNano</code> is a method of the <code>time.Time</code> type.
	The method call <code>aTime.UnixNano()</code> returns the number of nanoseconds
	elapsed since January 1, 1970 UTC to the time denoted by <code>aTime</code>.
	The return result is a value of type <code>int64</code>,
	which is the parameter type of the <code>rand.Seed</code> function.
	(Methods are special functions. We can learn methods in the article
	<a href="method.html">methods in Go</a> for details later.)
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>More About <code>fmt.Printf</code> Format Verbs</h3>

<p>
As the above has mentioned, if there is one format verb in the first argument
of a <code>fmt.Printf</code> call, it will be replaced with the string
representation of the second argument.
In fact, there can be mulitple format verbs in the first <code>string</code>
argument. The second format verb will be replaced with the string representation
of the third argument, and so on.
</p>

<div>
In Go 101, only the following listed format verbs will be used.
<ul>
<li>
	<code>%v</code>, which will be replaced with the general string representation of the corresponding argument.
</li>
<li>
	<code>%T</code>, which will be replaced with the type name or type literal of the corresponding argument.
</li>
<li>
	<code>%x</code>, which will be replaced with the hex string representation of the corresponding argument.
	Note, the hex string representations for values of some kinds of types are not defined.
	Generally, the corresponding arguments of <code>%x</code> should be integers,
	integer arrays or integer slices (arrays and slices will be explained in a later article).
</li>
<li>
	<code>%s</code>, which will be replaced with the string representation of the corresponding argument.
	The corresponding argument should be a string or byte slice.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Format verb <code>%%</code> represent a percent sign.
</p>

<p>
For more <code>Printf</code> format verbs, please read
the online <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/"><code>fmt</code> package documentation</a>,
or view the same documentation by running a local documentation server.
We can also run <code>go doc fmt</code> to view the documentation of the <code>fmt</code> standard package,
and run <code>go doc fmt.Printf</code> to view the documentation of the <code>fmt.Printf</code> function,
in a terminal.
</p>

<h3>About Package Folder Names</h3>

<p>
A code package may be composed of several source files.
These source files are located in the same folder.
Generally, a folder corresponds to one code package, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="go-sdk.html">official Go tools</a> recommend,
and often require, the folder
containing a third-party package to be put in the <code>src</code>
folder under any path specified in the <code>GOPATH</code> environment variable.
The import path of the third-party package is the relative path of
the package folder to the <code>src</code> folder.
The seperators in the path must be always <code>/</code> and can't be <code>\</code>.
For example, if the path of a package is <code>OneGoPath/src/a/b/pkg</code>
(or <code>OneGoPath\src\a\b\pkg</code> on Windows),
then its import path is <code>/a/b/pkg</code>.
</p>

<p>
A standard package has a higher import priority than a third-party package
if their import paths are identical.
So please try to avoid using the import path of a standard package
as the import path of a third-party package.
</p>

<p>
Later, we will call the packages each of which contains
the <code>main</code> entry functions as <b>program packages</b>,
and call other packages as <b>library packages</b>.
The names of program packages must be all <code>main</code>.
</p>

<p>
The name of folder containing a package
is not required to be the same as the package name.
However, for library packages, it will make package users confused if the name
of a package is different from the name of the package folder.
For example, if the name of a package is <code>foo</code> but its import path is
<code>x/y/bar</code>, then to call a function <code>F</code> in the package,
people may expect to use the qualified identifier <code>bar.F</code>.
However, in fact the correct qualified identifier is <code>foo.F</code>.
Package users must open the package source files to check what
the real name of the imported package is.
So please try to make the two names identical for every library package.
</p>

<p>
<code>main</code> packages are not recommended to be imported as library packages.
Although Go specification doesn't forbid importing <code>main</code> packages,
the official Go tools do (at least for Go SDK 1.11).
In practice, to avoid confusing,
it is best never to use <code>main</code> packages as library packages.
One the other hand, it is recommended to give each program package folder
a meaningful name other than its package name, <code>main</code>.
</p>

<div>
The official Go SDK will view package folders named as <code>internal</code>
and <code>vendor</code> as special package folders.
<ul>
<li>
	An <code>internal</code> package can only be imported by the packages
	which folders contains (either directly or indirectly) the
	<code>internal</code> package folder.
	In other words, a package can't import an <code>internal</code> package
	which is not located in the subtree of the folder of the package.
</li>
<li>
	The <code>vendor</code> folder under a package folder is used to
	store the dependency packages of the package.
	Please view the <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories">
	official documentation</a> for details.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>Package Load Order</h3>

<p>
Go doesn't support circular dependency.
If package <code>a</code> imports package <code>b</code>
and package <code>b</code> imports package <code>c</code>,
then package <code>c</code> can't import package <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>,
package <code>b</code> also can't import package <code>a</code>.
</p>

<p>
A package also can't import itself.
</p>

<p>
At run time, packages are loaded by their dependency orders.
A package will be loaded before all the packages which import it.
Each Go program contains only one program package,
which is the last package being loaded at run time.
</p>

<h3>The <code>init</code> Functions</h3>

<p>
There can be multiple functions named as <code>init</code> declared in one package,
even in one source code file.
The functions named as <code>init</code> must have no any
input parameters and return results.
</p>

<p>
The <code>init</code> functions in a package will be called
once and only once sequentially when the package is loaded.
However, the invocation order of these <code>init</code> functions
is not specified in Go specification.
So there shouldn't be dependency relations between the
<code>init</code> functions in one package.
</p>

<p>
For the standard Go compiler, the <code>init</code> functions in a source file
will be called from top to down.
</p>

<p>
All <code>init</code> functions in all involved packages in a program
will be called sequentially.
An <code>init</code> function in an importing package
will be called after all the <code>init</code> functions
declared in the dependency packages of the importing package for sure.
All <code>init</code> functions will be called
before invoking the <code>main</code> entry function.
</p>

<p>
All package-level variables in a package are initialized before
any <code>init</code> function is invoked.
</p>

<div>
Here is a simple example which contains two <code>init</code> functions:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func init() {
	fmt.Println("hi,", bob)
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("bye")
}

func init() {
	fmt.Println("hello,", smith)
}

func respectfulName(who string) string {
	return "Mr. " + who
}

var bob, smith = respectfulName("Bob"), respectfulName("Smith")
</code></pre>

The output of this program:
<pre class="output"><code>hi, Mr. Bob
hello, Mr. Smith
bye
</code></pre>

<p>
All package-level variables declared in a pacakge are initialized before
any <code>init</code> function declared in the same pacakge is called.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Full Package Import Form</h3>

<div>


In fact, the full form of an import declaration is

<pre><code class="language-go">import importname "path/to/package"
</code></pre>

<p>
where <code>importname</code> is optional,
its default value is the real name of the imported package.
In fact, the prefix token used in qualified identifiers is
the <code>importname</code>.
</p>

<p>
The full import declaration form is not used widely.
However, sometimes we must use it.
For example, if a source file imports two packages with the same name,
to avoid making compiler confused, we must use the full import form
to set a custom <code>importname</code> for at least one package in the two.
</p>

Here is an example of using full import declaration forms.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	format "fmt"
	random "math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	random.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) // set the random seed
	format.Print("A pseudo-random number: ", random.Uint32(), "\n")
	
	// The following two lines fail to compile.
	/*
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) // set the random seed
	fmt.Print("A pseudo-random number: ", rand.Uint32(), "\n")
	*/
}
</code></pre>

Some explanations:
<ul>
<li>
	we must use <code>format</code> and <code>random</code> as the
	prefix token in qualified identifiers, instead of the real package names
	<code>fmt</code> and <code>rand</code>.
</li>
<li>
	<code>Print</code> is another function in the <code>fmt</code> standard package.
	Like <code>Println</code> function calls,
	a <code>Print</code> function call can take arbitrary number of arguments.
	It will print the string representations of the passed arguments, one by one.
	If two consecutive arguments are both string values,
	then a space will be automatically inserted between them in the print result.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>importname</code> in the full form import declaration can be a dot
(<code>.</code>). Such imports are called dot imports.
To use the exported elements in the packages being dot imported,
the prefix part in qualified identifiers must be omitted.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	. "fmt"
	. "time"
)

func main() {
	Println("Current time:", Now())
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, <code>Println</code> instead of <code>fmt.Println</code>,
and <code>Now</code> instead of <code>time.Now</code> must be used.
</p>

<p>
Generally, dot imports are not recommended to be used in formal projects.
</p>

<p>
The <code>importname</code> in the full form import declaration can be blank identifier
(<code>_</code>). Such imports are called anonymous imports.
The importing source files can't use the exported resources in anonymously imported packages.
The purpose of anonymous imports is to initialize the imported packages
(each of <code>init</code> functions in the anonymously imported packages will be called once).
</p>

In the following example, all <code>init</code> functions declared in
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/">the
<code>net/http/pprof</code> standard package</a> will be called before the
<code>main</code> entry function is called.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import _ "net/http/pprof"

func main() {
	... // do somethings
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Each Non-anonymous Import Must Be Used Once</h3>

<div>
Except anonymous imports, at least one exported elements in
other imports must be used at once.
For example, the following example fails to compile.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "net/http"    // error: imported and not used
import . "time"      // error: imported and not used
import format "fmt"  // okay: used once below
import _ "math/rand" // okay: anonymous packages are not required to be used

func main() {
	format.Println() // use the imported "fmt" package
}
</code></pre>

</div>
