<h3>Usages</h3>

The main usage of <b><i>Gold</i></b> is to start a local docs server for a project,
to either read package docs or study source code of the project.
We can
<ul>
<li>run <code>gold .</code> to show docs of the package in the current directory (and all its dependency packages).</li>
<li>run <code>gold ./...</code> to show docs of all the package under the current directory (and all their dependency packages).</li>
<li>run <Code>gold std</code> to show docs of standard pacakges.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each of the above commands will open a browser window automatically.
We can use the <code>-s</code> or <code>-silent</code> options to turn off the behavior.
</p>

The second usage of <b><i>Gold</i></b> is to generate static HTML doc pages for a project:
<ul>
<li><code>gold -gen -dir=generated .</code></li>
<li><code>gold -gen -dir=generated ./...</code></li>
<li><code>gold -gen -dir=generated std</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>-dir</code> option is optional and its default value is <code>.</code> (the working directory).
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="https://github.com/go101/gold">the project readme file</a> to get more options.
</p>

<p>
The third usage of <b><i>Gold</i></b> is to serve files within a directory.
For example, we can run <code>gold -dir=.</code> (or simply <code>gold</code>)
from the HTML docs generation directory to view the generated docs in browser.

<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>

<h4>What does <b><i>Gold</i></b> mean?</h3>

<p>
"Gold" is an abbreviation of <b>Go</b> <b>l</b>ocal <b>d</b>ocs server/generator.
</p>

<h4>Why <b><i>Gold</i></b>?</h4>

<p>
I didn't find a Go tool showing type implementation relations, so I decided to write one.
In doing this, I got many new ideas which form the tool to the final <b><i>Gold</i></b> design.
</p>

<h4>Is <b><i>Gold</i></b> recommended to run locally?</h4>

<p>
Yes. But if you do want to serve your package docs on Internet,
it is best to serve the generated HTML static doc pages to lower the server cost.
</p>

<h4>What are the requirements to run <b><i>Gold</i></b>?</h4>

<p>
If a Go project needs cgo, then a proper C/C++ compiler is needed.
</p>

<p>
Some projects might need large memory capacity to analyze.
For example, the recommended memory capacity to analyze the Kubernetes project is 8G+.
However, 500M to 2G memory is okay for most Go projects.
