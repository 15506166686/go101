<li>
	We can use command <code>go build -x</code> to show what happen in a build process.
</li>
<li>
	We can use command <code>go build -race</code> to output Go binary files which support race detecting.
	When a data race is found in running the outputted programs, a panic will occur.

pattern in gcflags

An import path is a pattern if it includes one or more "..." wildcards,
each of which can match any string, including the empty string and
strings containing slashes. Such a pattern expands to all package
directories found in the GOPATH trees with names matching the
patterns.

To make common patterns more convenient, there are two special cases.
First, /... at the end of the pattern can match an empty string,
so that net/... matches both net and packages in its subdirectories, like net/http.
Second, any slash-separated pattern element containing a wildcard never
participates in a match of the "vendor" element in the path of a vendored
package, so that ./... does not match packages in subdirectories of
./vendor or ./mycode/vendor, but ./vendor/... and ./mycode/vendor/... do.
Note, however, that a directory named vendor that itself contains code
is not a vendored package: cmd/vendor would be a command named vendor,
and the pattern cmd/... matches it.
See golang.org/s/go15vendor for more about vendoring.

	<ul>
	<li>
		We can use command <code>go build -gcflags="-S"</code> to show the Go assembly code of the built program.
	</li>
	<li>
		We can use command <code>go build -gcflags="-l"</code> to disable function inline.
	</li>
	<li>
		We can use command <code>go build -gcflags="-N"</code> to disable compiler optimizations (not including function inline).
	</li>


	<li>
		We can use command <code>go build -gcflags="-d=ssa/check_bce/debug=1"</code> to check which lines
		need <a href="bounds-check-elimination.html">bound checking</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		We can use command <code>go build -gcflags="-B"</code> to disable bound checking.
		Warning: this is very not recommended to use in production.
		This flag may be not supported any more in later Go SDK versions.
	</li>
	<li>
		We can use command <code>go build -gcflags="-m -m"</code> to check which variables escape to heap.
		There can be one to four <code>-m</code>s in the <code>gcflags</code> option.
		More <code>-m</code>s, more information.
		We can also write <code>"-m -m"</code> as <code>"-m=2"</code>.

<li>
	We can use command <code>GOSSAFUNC=main go build</code> to output all SSA optimizations in a <code>ssa.html</code> file.

<!--
since Go 1.12,
* go test -benchtime=100x is supported
* The compiler now accepts a -lang flag to set the Go language version to use. For example,
  -lang=go1.8 causes the compiler to emit an error if the program uses type aliases,
  which were added in Go 1.9. Language changes made before Go 1.12 are not consistently enforced.
* go vet -shadow is replaced with
  go install golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/shadow/cmd/shadow
  go vet -vettool=$(which shadow)

<li>
	we can use command <code>go tool objdump -s aFunction aProgram</code> to show the Go assembly code of
	function <code>aFunction</code> in the Go binary program <code>aProgram</code>.
	For example, <code>go tool objdump -s main.main mygame</code> will print the Go assembly code
	of the <code>main</code> entry function in Go binary file <code>mygame</code>.
</li>
<li>
	We can use command <code>go tool nm aProgram</code> to show all the symbols in a Go binary file.
</li>



<!--li>
	We can use command <code>go vet -shadow</code> to find possible wrong variable shadowing uses caused by short variable declarations.
